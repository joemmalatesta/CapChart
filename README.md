# CapChart
### Sophmore Project :)

# Captcha requiring users to bring themselves back to Algebra 2 and solve for the slope of a graph.
## Obfuscated Code is run alongside the application but non-obfuscated javascript is in the hidden.js file


##### one thing we found difficult within chart js (that would enhance the UX) was being able to thicken the grid lines in order to more clearly see the graph.
##### this, however, is not that big of a deal because chart js allows you to hover over the points in the graph.
